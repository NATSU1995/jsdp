jsdp: a Java Stochastic Dynamic Programming Library
===================================================

http://gwr3n.github.io/jsdp/

jsdp provides a general purpose Java library for 
modeling and solving Stochastic Dynamic Programs. 

The library features a number of applications in 
maintenance, stochastic optimal control, and 
stochastic lot sizing; including the computation 
of optimal nonstationary (s,S) policy parameters, 
as discussed by Herbert Scarf in his seminal work 
the optimality of (s,S) policies in the dynamic 
inventory problem.
