Stochastic Dynamic Programming, originally introduced by [Richard Bellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman) in his seminal book [Dynamic Programming](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dynamic-Programming-Dover-Computer-Science/dp/0486428095), is a branch of Stochastic Programming that deals with multistage decision processes and takes a \"functional equation\" approach to the discovery of optimum policies. \r\n\r\n### The Library\r\njsdp provides a general purpose Java library for modeling and solving Stochastic Dynamic Programs. The library features a number of applications in maintenance, stochastic optimal control, and stochastic lot sizing; including the computation of optimal nonstationary (s,S) policy parameters, as discussed by [Herbert Scarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Scarf) in his seminal work [the optimality of (s s) policies in the dynamic inventory problem](https://statistics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/KAR%20ONR%2011.pdf).\r\n\r\nTo learn more please take a tour of our [Wiki](https://github.com/gwr3n/jsdp/wiki).\r\n\r\n### About the author\r\njsdp is maintained by [Roberto Rossi](https://sites.google.com/site/robros/Home?pli=1) (@gwr3n), Reader at the University of Edinburgh.",
